            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Its Author is a Perſon that hath gotten ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation by his Writings, which I can hardly perſwade my ſelf he would willingly Hazard, by Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Fictions on the World: And that Sincerity he hath diſcovered in his other Works (by which he hath Expoſed himſelf, not only to the Rage of a Party, as malicious as powerfull, but to the diſpleaſure of his Friends, by that juſt ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Freedom he uſeth in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their Miſcarriages,) may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſecure us, againſt the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of Falſhood in this.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e was generally accounted as eminent in Prudence, Wiſdom and Piety, as moſt in <hi>France:</hi> He had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59835:8"/>ſuch things as made him conſiderable; yet none excelled him in mildneſs and ſweetneſs of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in his Family. My Father had never but one Siſter, for whom he had always an extraordinary love, and this Siſter is ſtyled <hi>Madam de Proſſes,</hi> who is here with me; and though my Mother were ſtill living, yet I am more obliged to my Aunt than to my Mother, as you will hereafter ſee.</p>
               <p>Love, which ſometimes delights to ſhew its force on the wiſeſt ſpirits, made my Father himſelf do what he would certainly have diſliked in another. For he fell in love with my Mother, who was in her time one of the handſomeſt and compleateſt Ladies in all the Province, and was beſides of a very Noble and Rich Family; but that would have made no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion at all on him, had his Mind been free. At firſt he only loved out of Gallantry, that he might not differ from all other young men, who have always, ſome Inclination; but at length his Love got ſuch a victory over him, and made him ſo Earneſt in his ſuit, that he engaged my mothers affections towards him, who heard him univerſally commended, and their Marriage was diſcourſed of.</p>
               <p>Love hath indeed in it ſomewhat very wonderful, it finds Expedients for all things, and eaſily ſurmounts the greateſt difficulties. My Father was always, even to his Death, ſo reſolute an <hi>Huguenot,</hi> as that the Flames were not capable of altering him. My Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was a moſt obſtinate Catholick: Both were ſo far from embracing each others Religion, as that they would fain have had each other take up their own. But at length ſome Mediators (whereof Love was the chief) made up an Agreement between them on theſe three Conditions, <hi>viz.</hi> That they ſhould be married firſt by a Prieſt, and afterwards by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. That they ſhould never diſcourſe of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And, That of the Children they ſhould have, the Sons ſhould be educated in the Religion of their Father, and the Daughters in that of their Mother.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59835:8"/>All theſe Articles were very punctually obſerved on both ſides, eſpecially that of ſilence in matters of Religion, out of prudence to prevent Contentions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But Mother, ſaid I, my Brother is Learned, and ſhould I diſcourſe with him about this, we muſt come

               <p>Though my Mother was a Woman of ſpirit, yet ſhe did not penetrate into the Conſequences of this buſineſs, which were yet viſible enough, for by my urging my Brother to change his Religion, I gave him opportunity to make me the ſame Propoſals, and he had this advantage over me, in that he could ſpeak what he knew, (for he had diligently ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both Religions) which I could not do, becauſe they had taken more Pains to fill my mind with Prejudices againſt the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> than to fortifie me with ſolid and powerful Reaſons againſt them.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59835:12"/>it, and that I would not amuſe my ſelf to diſpute with you. You intend then Siſter, ſaid he, to make me yield without an Engagement, which I'll never do either in temporals or ſpirituals. You may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute againſt me if you pleaſe; I'll not diſpute at all, (ſaid I) I had rather leave you in your Error. Ah (ſaid he) if you will not diſpute with me, I'll diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with you, and therefore now prepare to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your ſelf.</p>
               <p>Immediately, without giving me time to anſwer, he took up a little Crucifix that was on the Table, what do you intend to do with this? Of what uſe is it? It brings my Saviour (replyed I) to my mind; is it poſſible, (anſwered he) that you need ſuch helps as theſe to mind you of your Saviour? Can't you think on him without having a Crucifix before your Eyes? indeed your Devotion muſt needs be at a low ebb, if you can't mind God unleſs you have this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you: But you know (ſaid I) that our mind is apt to be diſtracted, and to run out after variety of things, and that we muſt often reduce it to its proper Object by the ſight of ſuch things as fix its thoughts. I ſhall turn (ſaid he) your own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument upon your ſelf. 'Tis the Crucifix that you look on, that diſtracts you in your contemplation of Jeſus Chriſt: For Siſter (added he) when you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Crucifix, you cannot chuſe but ſay in your ſelf, there's the Image of Jeſus Chriſt, and when you think on the Image, you think not directly on Jeſus Chriſt. And, as you know, it is impoſſible at once to look upon a man and his Picture; ſo 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to have an Image before your Eyes, and yet to think only on the Original. If you cannot think on Jeſus Chriſt unleſs you have a Crucifix before you, 'tis a plain Evidence that your Piety is very miſerable, ſince it owes its ſupport and maintenance to ſuch wretched means. 'Tis as much as if you had ſaid, that you ſtand in ſuch abſolute need of an Image, that you cannot awaken your Zeal without it: But if
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59835:12"/>you pretend that your ſpirit is carried out after your Saviour, that you do not at all mind the Image; of what uſe then is it? Could you not without it do what the Word of God Commands, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth?</hi> Think you that a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſer, or Image can inſpire you with ſuch thoughts as are neceſſary for your Salvation? and ha'n't you reaſon to expect from converſe with God in Spirit by means of Prayer, ſuch bleſſings as are much more great and ſingular? Come then to your ſelf, and be aſhamed of uſing what Chriſt never approved of, and which diſturbs the mind in, and turns it from its beſt Meditation.</p>
               <p>Such things as are the Objects of ſenſe, and have an External reſemblance given them, which depend on the will or skill of the Painters or Engravers, are far more capable of ſinking man into vain and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Imaginations, than of freeing them from them. Thus we ſee that moſt Catholicks do inſenſibly ſuffer their Devotion to run out after the Image rather than the Original. You ſay what you pleaſe Brother, (ſaid I) and charge us with ſuch things as are very remote from our true ſentiments; I'll charge you (ſaid he) with nothing but what I'll prove. Is it not certain, that amongſt all the Images of Jeſus Chriſt and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixes, ſome are more honoured than others? You ſee great Crucifixes in Churches, before which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body proſtrate themſelves; theſe are great Lords in compariſon of the poor Crucifixes, that are on Brigdes and high-ways, who are happy enough, if one amongſt a thouſand moves his Cap at them.</p>
               <p>If all Crucifixes ſerve to repreſent to you your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour nailed to the Croſs, they have all one and the ſame dignity, nor ought you to ſhow more reſpect to ſome, than to others; ſeeing their dignity reſults not from the matter whereof they are made; nor the skill of the Workman, who gives them what Figure he pleaſeth; why then do you make ſo great a difference between them, that you'll ſcarce youch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59835:13"/>ſome of them ſo much as a look, when you fall on your knees before others? what anſwer will you make to this? I ſay (replyed I) if we make any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between theſe Images, 'tis becauſe ſome of them do more naturally and livelily repreſent our Saviour, than others do, and conſequently are more capable of warming our Zeal: So that (replyed he ſcoffingly) your Zeal depends in part on the hand of Carver or Painter; I believe (added he) you your ſelves would laugh at ſuch reaſons: But know, that if it be good to make uſe of Images, as helps of Devotion, according to your Principles the ſame ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour muſt be rendred to all: To thoſe whoſe work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip diſcover leaſt skill as well as others; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as I ſaid before, their dignity reſults not from their Matter or Figure, but from the Original, whoſe Images they are, or rather from the End men aimed at in ſetting them up, to repreſent Jeſus Chriſt: So that if you make any difference between Images, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as made of more excellent materials, or with greater Art, and if you honour ſome more than you do others, you thereby ſhow that your mind is more fixed upon the Image, than on the Original, and conſequently can't free your ſelves from being guilty of a kind of Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Idolatry, ſaid I, (interrupting him,) I am not yet ſo ignorant, but I know the difference between Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Idols; and I believe none can juſtly charge me with Idolatry, for having before me the Image of my Saviour, when I adore him. They are Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters who believe there is ſome Deity in the Images themſelves; but for ſuch who regard them only as repreſentations, and whoſe mind tend only to the Original, they certainly can't deſerve this Name. Many Catholicks, (replyed my Brother,) yea even moſt, believe that there is an hidden Vertue in ſome Images, whether Crucifixes or others, which work Miracks, which others don't do. Every body runs after theſe Miracle-working Images, whereas the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59835:13"/>others are comparatively but little regarded. I ask on now, whether ſuch as flock to theſe Images, don't <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I Could not once cloſe my Eyes for ſleep the whole Night after I had had this Diſcourſe with my Brother; I knew not what reaſon I had for my Religion, I was convinced that he had ſome for his, and even before he had ſaid any thing to me, I was diſguſted with many things in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> In the Morning I fell into a ſhort Nap, in which I had ſuch a Dream as diſturbed me more than all the reſt. Methought I ſaw my Father ſick unto Death, who ſaid unto me, <hi>Juſtina,</hi> God who takes from you your earthly Father, will himſelf be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to you, on Condition that you ſerve him in Spirit and Truth, which you cannot do, whilſt you make Profeſſion of thoſe Superſtitions in which you have been Educated; if you rencunce it, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely embrace the Religion of our Churches, you ſhall indeed be terribly Perſecuted and ſtript of your Eſtate, but yet you ſhall end your days in happineſs and tranquility of ſpirit, and when you leave this Life, ſhall enter on another, in compariſon of which, the choiceſt Enjoyments in this World are but Vanity and Emptineſs: But if you obſtinately reſiſt the Will of your God, you ſhall dye miſerably, in the moſt grievous Troubles and Deſpair, which ſhall be the forerunners of Eternal Torments. Theſe words methought were his laſt, Death preventing his ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more. When I awoke, my Eyes were full of Tears, and I was terribly diſquieted for three days with this Dream, ſo that I reſolved to get my ſelf inſtructed by my Brother, both in my own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and in that of the <hi>Hugonots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was ſcarce got out of my Bed, before I ſaw my Brother coming into my Chamber; as ſoon as I ſaw him, I ſent my Waiting Gentlewoman on an
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59835:18"/>Errand, and he without loſing any time, ſaid Siſter, I am come to wiſh you a good Morning, not do I come empty handed, ſeeing I bring you what is more worth than the Crown of our King. You are then (ſaid I) much inriched this Night, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his Preſent, which was the New Teſtament very neatly bound. You ſaid yeſterday, (added he) that you Worſhiped your Crucifix to excite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I thanked him, and promiſed to follow his Advice; after which he left me, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute my Mother, towards whom he was very exac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Carriage.</p>
               <p>In the mean time I opened the New Teſtament, and found that he had Written in the Frontiſpiece of the Book, theſe words of the <hi>Revelation, Behold I ſtand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

After this I withdren into my Cloſet, where I read the Hiſtory of our Lord's Paſſion, Death and Reſurrection, as 'tis writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the twenty ſixth, twenty ſeventh and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eighth Chapters of St. <hi>Matthew.</hi> This reading ſo affected me, that I never Prayed to God ſo heartily in all my Life. After my Prayer I continued to read ſtill, and I found that as I read, the Word made a paſſage into my Soul, which filled me with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible Joy. Hereupon my Brother came to me, to Conduct me into my Mothers Chamber, who was aſtoniſhed at my negligence, but before I left my own Chamber, I carefully lockt up my New-Teſtament, which many Reaſons obliged me to keep ſafe.</p>

The Lady anſwered that Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with a great deal of Civility, and her Husband, after having ſufficiently entangled both of them by this Interview, and diverted himſelf, reſolved to tell each of them, who the other was. Ah Sir, ſaid he to my Father, is it poſſible that you have forgotten

                  <hi>Mademoiſelle de Graſſans,</hi> and you Madam, Monſieur <hi>De Ponſins,</hi> (which was my Fathers Name in his Youth, and my Brothers alſo, which he left but eight or nine months ſince, to take that of <hi>Ombreval.</hi>) Theſe words awakened both Mademoiſelle <hi>De Roche Blanche</hi> and my Father out of their ſurprize, ſo that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently knowing one another, they began to embrance and Compliment each other; but my Father was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the Civilities of the Son and Daughter of Monſieur <hi>De Roche-Blanche.</hi>

               <p>To explain this Myſtery, you muſt know, that my Father during the Wars in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> where he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his firſt feats of Arms, being in his Winter Quarters, fell acquainted with <hi>Madamoiſelle de Graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans,</hi> who was then one of the moſt Eminent Perſonages of the Religion in all <hi>Guyenne,</hi> and who, not to ſpeak of her great Eſtate, had without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute a perfect Beauty, with other wonderful Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties above her Sex. My Father loved her, and it may be his Love would have been accepted if this Lady had not diſpoſed of her Heart before to a Man of great merit. Yet ſhe ſtill retained a great deal of Eſteem and Friendſhip for my Father; which length of time could not deſtroy, as ſhe had often told her husband, who knowing how acceptable it would be to her, brought my Father to his houſe, to renew this Ancient Friendſhip. For although <hi>Mounſier de Roche-Blanche</hi> was of <hi>Poiton,</hi> yet he came to live in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> becauſe of a great Eſtate which his Uncle had left him, who made him his Heir. And the reaſon why my Father and he were not acquainted, as Gentlemen uſe to be, eſpecially when they are of one Religion, was becauſe they they had both chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their Names.</p>

               </p>
               <p>When my Father had ended, I again kiſſed his hand, and had only Power to ſay thus. Monſieur, ſaid I, I will not (ſaid he) have you call me thus, I am your Father. Father, then ſaid I, I am ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely

No, my Child, (ſaid he) you muſt know that true Piety doth not make Perſons raſh in their Actions: I'le give your Brother ſuch Directions as I judge fit, do you obey him, and you'l do well enough.</p>
               <p>At this very inſtant my Brother came into the Chamber: I am very glad to ſee you, ſaid my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to recommend your Siſter to your Care, to whom you muſt for the future be a Father, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it coſt you. Mounſieur and Madam <hi>de Roche Blanche</hi> will aſſiſt her in making her Abjuration, which as ſoon as ſhe hath done, take care to ſend her into <hi>Germany</hi> to our Relations there. I know your Mother will be mightily enraged at it, but 'tis better to obey God than Men. Uſe ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy in what you do, as a buſineſs of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance requires; eſpecially let none know which way your Siſter is gone, nor where ſhe is: I have taken Care that you ſhall be ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Money for this Expedition: In other things follow your own judgment. Above all, begg God that he would direct you to ſuch means as are moſt proper for the accompliſhment of this Deſign. As for other Affairs, follow my Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; eſpecially ſhow all imaginable reſpect to your Mother, as your own Duty, her Virtue, and that tender Love ſhe hath for you requires.</p>
               <p>My Father would have continued his Diſcourſe, but was ſeized with a fainting Fit, without doubt occaſioned from his ſpeaking beyond his ſtrength. I was ſo affrighted at it, that I cry'd out ſo loud that all the Servants of the Houſe ran to our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. At length he revived again, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that a Miniſter might be called. I have (ſaid my Brother) ſent for one, but he cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be here this Night: Well (ſaid my Father)
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59835:50"/>this ſhall not hinder my dying like a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. He deſired to ſee my Mother, and I went to call her, and ſhe came into my Father's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſo pale and diſorder d, that I thought ſhe would have Dyed before him. Madam, (ſaid he) this is the time, the Moment of our Separation, after having lived a long time very happily toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: I deſired to ſee you for two Reaſons, the one to thank you for the Care you have taken of me, and that Affection you have ſhown me; and the other that you might be a Witneſs of my Death, and that you may judge whether it be poſſible that ſuch as dye in the Lord, as I am ſure through Grace I ſhall, ſhould be damn'd, as your Confeſſors oblige you to believe.</p>
               <p>My Mother could not hear theſe ſad words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinking down on my Father's Bed, through Grief: Alas, Sir, ſaid ſhe, may I not Dye with you! What ſhould I do in this World, having Ioſt you, after having lived ſo ſweetly with you!

As ſoon as we were come, I fell into a deeper ſwoon than ever; ſo that they could not bring me to my ſelf, either by throwing water on my face, or by any torment they inflicted on me. At length we arrived at the Gate of the beſt Inn in the whole Place, where the old <hi>Rabours</hi> demanded whether there were any Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for us: the Landlady of the Houſe replyed, That all her Chambers were taken up by the Company of another Coach, except two, which, if we liked them, were at our ſervice, and invited us to ſee them: For my part, (ſaid the Nephew) I judge it beſt to take any that we can have; for ſeeing ſhe now lyes in a ſwoon, if ſhe ſhould happen to dye under our hands, we ſhall be accuſed of being her Murderers; and her Mother who hath committed her to you, will not fail of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the Life of her Daughter of you, and make her ſelf a Party againſt you. You ſay well, Couſen, ſaid the Unkle, (as I was ſince told) let us carry her up, her indiſpoſition is cauſed only by weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, faſting, and the fatigues that ſhe hath endured; one moments reſt and refreſhment will recover her, and to morrow wee'l continue her Journey.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid thus, they took me out of the Coach, more like a dead Perſon than a living, and laid me on a Bed, where I found my ſelf as ſoon as I revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, encompaſſed with a great many People, who were very earneſt to help me; amongſt others there were two very beautiful Ladies that ſate on my Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and a Lady that ſeemed to be their Mother. I look't upon them with a great deal of diſturbance, which Perſons uſe to be under upon their recovery out of a ſwoon: Is it poſſible (ſaid I) that I am yet alive? Oh how much better for me is Death than Life! Madamoiſelle, ſaid the old Lady, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>I thank you, ſaid I, yet I have thought upon a way in which you may advantageouſly ſerve me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expoſing your ſelf to any danger, and I aſſure you, you have reaſon to promiſe your ſelf a better gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity from me, than you could expect from my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though you had ſucceeded in your project. Go to your Companions, ſhow them the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of carrying me hence; and that conſequently they muſt expect no further Reward from my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but aſſure them that if they will all of them return home, they ſhall receive the four <hi>Louis d'ors</hi> from my Brother, to whom I'll write in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and for my own part I promiſe you ſix, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what you may expect from my Liberality.

               <p>Indeed, Madamoiſelle, replyed the Trooper, you have brought a very pleaſant Stratagem into my head, and which may have good ſucceſs. Let ſome one of the Gentlemen that are with you, feign him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ſent from Monſieur <hi>de Ponſins,</hi> and let him enquire at this houſe whether you are, or have been here, or any can diſcover where you are gone?

               <p>This Device was very well approved of by all our little Aſſembly, and ſomething alſo was added to it, and one of the Gentlemen offered to act the part of the Trooper that was to be ſent out upon the Enquiry; he immediately drew on his Boots, and fitted himſelf for the Journey, and having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his Horſe in a readineſs, he went down by a private pair of Stairs, mounted, and having fetcht a compaſs, about Day-break he returned by the High-way to the Houſe in which we were, where being come, he deſired to ſpeak with the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, upon which the Landlady appearing, Madam, (ſaid he) is there not a Coach lately come to your Houſe?

               <p>After theſe Reſolutions were taken, and all the Troopers except the four firſt were ſent back, and the reckoning diſcharged, we reſolved to ſtop there all that day and the Night following, to refreſh and reſt our ſelves.

               <p>Our Converſation together was ſo long, that my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interrupted us, inviting us to take a little Walk. Immediately we went into the Garden, where my Brother taking Monſieur <hi>de Haute-Cour</hi> aſide, diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a conſiderable while with him and the Old <hi>Raboars,</hi> who diſcovered a great many things to him which I could never perſwade him to tell me, for fear of grieving me. Thus much only I learn'd, that my Mother had reſolved to leave me in the Convent du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my Life, to diſinherit my Brother, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the greateſt part of her Eſtate on the Jeſuites, all at the inſtigation of the Father <hi>Matthew,</hi> who had made himſelf more abſolutely than ever, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of her Spirit.</p>
               <p>This Reſolution which my Mother had taken up againſt my Brother, vex't me more than all that ſhe had done to me, for methougt 'twas horribly unnatural.

               <p>About two ſhort Leagues from Madam <hi>de la Gard</hi>'s Caſtle, is a Mountain, famous for the large Caves that are in it: We were reſolved to ſee it, and to this end ordered our Dinner to be ſent early in the Morning, and by Ten a Clock in the Forenoon we alſo came thither. We were provided with a Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-box and Torches to ſee theſe Caves, and only made a ſhort Collation, reſerving our Dinner 'till we ſhould return. We entred into the Caves by the aſſiſtance of our Torches, but before we had gone ſixty Paces, going into the Mountain from one Cave to the other, the Daughters of <hi>Madam de la Garde</hi> and I began to be afraid. <hi>Madam de la Garde</hi> laught at our fear, and continued on her way 'till we came to a certain place, where there were ſo many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavities, that many Eccho's repeated the leaſt noiſe that we made. The Primitive Chriſtians, ſaid <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam de la Garde,</hi> Praiſed God in Caves and Holes of the Earth, in this we ought to imitate them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Point of being reduced to the ſame ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; and having ſaid thus, ſhe began to ſing the 90th.

               <p>We made a ſhort pauſe between every Verſe, that we might have the pleaſure of Hearing the Eccho's repeat what we had ſung, which ſo raviſht our minds with admiration, that we began to lay aſide all ſear; when we had ſung this laſt Verſe,</p>

               <p>This mournful Voice having ſung theſe Words, we heard no more, except ſome ſoft Groans and Sighs. I verily believe, ſaid Madam <hi>de la Garde</hi> to me, that this is ſome afflicted Chriſtian of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, let's go and help him. Hereupon we went towards the place whence the Voice ſeemed to come,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59835:70"/>where we ſaw ſomewhat like a Man, of a proper Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cloathed with ſuch Garments as appeared to have been once very genteel and handſome, but ſo torn and covered with duſt, that 'twas impoſſible for us to judge what Stuff or Colour it was of: The Countenance of this Apparition was lean, pale, and dejected; he had on his Head a Cap, like thoſe that are uſually worn by <hi>Polanders,</hi> which covered his grey Hairs, which were all ruffled, and a great Beard, grown quite our of Faſhion, of the ſame colour with his Hait. In a word, every thing both in the Perſon and Habit of this Solitary, was extraordinary and aſtoniſhing. We were much afraid at the ſight of him, and had it not been for Madam <hi>de la Garde,</hi> who on this occaſion had more Courage than the Gentlemen that accompanied us, we had certainly fled; but our Fear vaniſhed as ſoon as we heard him begin to Diſcourſe with Madam <hi>de la Garde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bleſſed be God, faid he, that being confined to this Cave for the reſt of my days, God hath been ſo gracious to me as to give me the ſight of ſome good Chriſtians, that have not bowed the Knee to the <hi>Roman</hi> Idols, nor been partakers of their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations: Indeed, added he, I had forgotten what Joy means, before I ſaw you, but now my Heart is full of it, for I ſee that God hath not forſaken me, ſeeing I am viſited by Perſons that fear his Name, and call on him in Purity and Truth.</p>
               <p>Good God, replyed <hi>Madam de la Garde,</hi> without making any other reflection on what he ſaid, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I ſhould know your Voice, which much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles that of a Man of great worth of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who hath been for ſome time loſt, and was thought to be made away privately, ſince none could give any Account of him. She ſpake theſe laſt words ſo low, that none but the Solitary could hear them. I believe, Madam, anſwered he, that you know me, for I know you very well, you are <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59835:70"/>de la Garde,</hi> a true Pattern of Virtue, Piety and Conſtancy to all thoſe of the Religion, and I am — 'Tis enough, ſaid ſhe, interrupting him, not ſuffering him to tell who he was, becauſe of the Lacqueys that were preſent, and bare the Torches: After which ſhe took him aſide, and they diſcourſed together a large hour, during which we viſited ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the little Caves, in which we found nothing of Curioſity; ſo that we came back as ſoon as we heard that Madam <hi>de la Garde</hi> had ended her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with the Solitary, whom ſhe earneſtly invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to eat with us; but he excuſed himſelf very handſomely, and with much Civility, and returned to his dark Habitation.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as we were out of the Cave, and Madam <hi>de la Garde</hi> had ſent away the Lacqueys, about ſome little buſineſs: You would never think, (my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) ſaid ſhe, that this poor Man I diſcourſed with but now, was not only famous once for Zeal, Piety, Vertue and Charity, but alſo for his Riches and Reputation. We may truly ſay, that he was the ſupport of ſuch poor men as were perſecuted for their Religion: Such as were ſpoiled of their Eſtates he maintained out of his own; ſuch as their Enemies endeavoured unjuſtly to oppreſs he defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the Afflicted found a great deal of Comfort from him. He made good his Ground for a long time againſt Doctors, Great Men and Soldiers, againſt Prieſts and Monks. When the greateſt Tempeſt began to ariſe againſt us, and the Paſtor of his Church being terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Apprehenſions of Danger, left it to the Diſcretion of the wild Boars of the Forreſt, he alone ſtood faſt, and bear the ſhock of all the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults that were made upon this poor Flock. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the Rage of the Enemies of the Truth againſt him grew ſo great, that the leaſt Injury they did him was to take his Eſtate from him. He was forced to flye from his home, and to wander many
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59835:71"/>days in continual danger of being ſeized and ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In the mean while the Members of his Church were ſcattered, many of them fled, ſome into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> others into <hi>England,</hi> and ſome that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound revolted from the Truth. For his part he was reſolved not to tarry in <hi>France,</hi> but to retire into <hi>Germany:</hi> And whilſt the Clouds were ga her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Tempeſt, with which he was at laſt over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He found conveniences beyond his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, as certain Steps that lead up to the top of the Rock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> where he choſe his Lodging in a place that's dry and wholeſome, whereas the Air of the lower part of the Cave is moiſt and choaking. As for his proviſions the Young Man that's with him, goes from time to time to buy them for him. But wee'l ſpeak more largely of him another time; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the mean time the Lacqueys took care to ſpread our Proviſions on the Graſs, ſo that we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Mode: And we ſhould have been much inclined to Mirth and Pleaſure, had not the ſurprizing adventure of the Solitary made us ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. 'Tis indeed ſo rare a thing for Perſons of the Reformed Religion to retire from the World, after this manner, that one Example may paſs for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. You wonder at this, ſaid Madam <hi>de la Garde,</hi> for my part I don't at all. They uſe us as they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly did the Primitive Chriſtians; and is it ſtrange
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59835:71"/>if ſome amongſt us imitate thoſe holy Perſons, who retired into Deſarts, and holes of Rocks? May not the ſame Calamities inſpire Perſons with the ſame Reſolutions, how ridiculous ſoever they may ſeem to the Men of this World.</p>
               <p>Dinner being ended, Madam <hi>de la Garde,</hi> ſent Monſieur <hi>d' Arbaux,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>de Chables</hi> into the Rock, to ſee if they could meet with the Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, with whom ſhe earneſtly deſired to have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conference. They ſoon met him, for he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their voice, and even what they ſaid, (the voice eaſily running from one end of the Rock to the other,) came to them, and had the complaiſance to meet us at the entrance of the Cave, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the diſorder he was in.

               <p>'Tis not without Reaſon, ſaid ſhe, that Truth is ſaid to be found in the Deſarts and Caves of the Earth, whilſt falſhood too often eſtabliſheth her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in the Palaces of Kings; ſince we ſee ſuch as love the Truth, both in Faith, and in Diſcourſe, chuſe the moſt ſavage places to dwell in. It may be, replyed the Solitary, that Truth would be found in the Palaces of Kings, did not the greatneſs of its ſplendor offend them, and diſturb their quiet, they would not have its beams ſo near; nor would they be told, that after all they are but men, compoſed of the ſame materials, and as neceſſarily obnoxious to Death as others are. How much leſs can they endure to be told of their Vices, Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries, Imperfections, Infidelity and Falſhood.</p>
               <p>Do us the Favour, ſaid Madam <hi>de la Garde,</hi> to give us an Account of the Motives that have obliged you to embrace ſo ſtrange a kind of Life as that you now lead: That I ſhall willingly do, anſwered he. The firſt was the deplorable Eſtate of our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. I reckon their Eſtate deplorable, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59835:72"/>of the Perſecutions they ſuffer from without, but becauſe of their own Infirmities and Failures. I will not (Madam) act the Saint, nor make any Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures to Holineſs; for I account my ſelf a great Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet were I not able to behold the Univerſal Corruption of Manners amongſt us, without being filled with Horror and Amazement: Alas, we have imitated the Children of this World, and in ſome reſpects have out-done them too; Pride, Luxury, Diſſoluteneſs, have abounded amongſt us, as amongſt the Heathen; we have offered Incenſe to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, our Animoſities, our Covetouſneſs, and our Ambition; yea a great part of our Paſtors have ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the ſame Courſe. Alas! Ladies, alas Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, (added he with a deep ſigh) is not this cauſe enough for a Man to wiſh for a place far from ſo ſcandalous a Society? yet not making any Schiſm in the Faith, or Worſhip that we profeſs.</p>
               <p>How often have I ſaid with the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah, Oh that I had a Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tage of Travellers in the Wilderneſs, there would I abide, and there would I bewail the ſins of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my People.</hi> I would indeed have done ſo, had not my Conſcience told me, that 'twas no time to make a Retreat when we are called to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; no time to hide our ſelves when we ought to ſhow our ſelves to them that are weak in the Faith, to be to them Examples of Conſtancy and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. I ſtayed therefore in the World, out of a deſign of ſerving others; I made uſe of this time to warn, both Conſiſtories, Paſtors, and People, that a dreadful ſtorm was gathering, which would fall upon us e're we were aware: But I was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Phanatick, a Viſionary, a Dreamer, a falſe Prophet, an Enthuſiaſt, and what elſe they pleaſed; yea, men were ſo far from believing me, that they laugh'd at what I ſaid.</p>
               <p>Oh how willingly would I have ſpent all my Blood, that I might not have been a true Prophet
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59835:72"/>of the Deſolation that's come upon us! But had I been ſilent, that could not have prevented it. 'Tis not without very good reaſon that the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls men ſometimes brutiſh, ſometimes mad and Fooliſh; for although they are told, that the danger is inevitable, that the hand is lifted up to ſtrike the deadly blow, unleſs they repent, yet they will ſtill perſevere in their Iniquities, and add to the meaſure of their Crimes; they are not content to walk leiſurably to their ruine, but run headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; and any one that did but ſeriouſly conſider their actions, would imagine that they were afraid they ſhould not be miſerable ſoon enough. We have ſeen our Miſeries coming upon us by degrees. We have had time to have prevented them by our Tears and Repentance, and yet we have been ſo brutiſh, ſo beſotted, as that we have neither wept nor repented.</p>
               <p>At length thoſe evils that threatned us are come upon us, and have as it were ſeized us by the Throat when we leaſt expected them. Our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are demoliſhed, and our Religious Aſſemblies interdicted in a thouſand places where they were before free. In a word, you know your ſelves all that hath befallen us, ſo that there's no need that I ſhould make ſuch a doleful recapitulation of it. How often have I longed for Death, and envied the condition of thoſe that are at reſt in the Lord! How often have I accounted thoſe happy that are gone home before the coming of our Anguiſhes! or thoſe whom Death ſurprizing in their Cradles, hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from ſeeing thoſe Afflictions wherewith we are at preſent continually exerciſed!</p>
               <p>Was not this enough to make me hate the world, and retire into ſome Deſart where I might ſhed tears in abundance, without fear of contradiction? For the Cruelty we are at preſent under, is ſo great, that our very tears are made Crimes. We are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59835:73"/>and dare not ſay ſo, nor make uſe of the term Perſecution, or Perſecutors. We muſt look p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eaſantly in the midſt of Torments, and the bate ſaying that we are under Afflictions, and groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, is enough to make us accounted bad Subjects: For my part, having my heart full of Grief, I was forced to leave all commerce with men, and to ſeek in the thickeſt Forreſts and darkeſt Caves, a place where I might freely complain of our Miſeries.</p>
               <p>But that that was the immediate cauſe of this Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Retreat, was a Journey which I made to Court, about the Affairs of our Churches, and my own. I ſaw ſuch abominable Corruptions there, as were not exceeded under the Regency of <hi>Katherin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

What vile Diſcourſes did I hear from the higheſt Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Kingdom, both at their Tables, and in their Walks, about their horrible and unuatural Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Ordinary Vices are at preſent accounted Vertues, while ſuch Crimes are perpetrated, as have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought Torments of Fire and Brimſtone from Heaven upon a People; not to ſpeak of thoſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Blaſphemies that are daily heard, ſuch as the Devils themſelves could never have invented, and a thouſand other Villanies which I ſhall not name, and would to God I had never heard.</p>
               <p>I was one day thinking upon theſe things, when a Gentleman came to make this Propoſal to me, That if I would abandon the Hereſie of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and ſubmit my ſelf to the true Catholick, Apoſtolick, and Roman Church, I ſhould not only preſerve mine own Eſtate, but ſhould alſo be advanced to extraordinary Dignities. He that made me this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, was one of the greateſt Debauchees of all the Court: He preſſed me much to a Complyance,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59835:73"/>remonſtrating that the advantage was very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and that 'twould be my Prudence to embrace this offer, whilſt the Court was in ſo good an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.

               <p>The King, (ſaid I, interrupting him with an heat whereof I was not Maſter) the King would do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and act more for the advantage of his State, did he purge it of an infinite number of Debauchees, Blaſphemers, Atheiſts, and ſuch like Traſh, than by dealing ſo ſeverely with ſo great a number of good Subjects, who are guilty of no other Crime but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to go to Maſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe words were too ſincere for the Age in which we live, and alſo expoſed me to much Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, againſt which I had no other defence but flight. Oh how much ſafer is it at preſent for men to reflect upon the Conduct of the Almighty God, than on that of the Kings of the Earth! Every body knew my Accuſer to be one of the moſt Prophane, the greateſt Blaſphemer, Atheiſt and Debauchee of all the Court: Yet he had never received any check for his diſorders, never was in the leaſt puniſhed for them; but I, a poor <hi>Huguenot,</hi> could no ſooner ſpeak a true and righteous word, but I preſently found a Million of Enemies arm'd againſt me: On the one hand, all the Libertines and Debauchees of the Court were enraged againſt me, for preſuming to reprove their way of living; theſe falſly accuſed me for ſpeaking irreverently of the King and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: On the other hand, the Society of the

               <p>Yet I remained very ſecure at my own Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, never imagining that I was purſued with ſo much fury; the terri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This (continued the Solitary) was a terrible Billet; yet having made it my buſineſs to prepare my mind for the moſt cruel Events, I was not much ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at the greateſt Threatnings. I prepared my ſelf for my departure with all imaginable Secrecy, taking leave of my moſt intimate Friends, and returning to my Lodgings <hi>Incognito,</hi> where I ſtaid ſome time, 'till I could receive a Summe of Money, which I kept againſt a time of need, and 'till I had hid ſome Papers of great Importance; which having done, I reſolved to leave <hi>France</hi> as ſoon as I could, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied only with a young Man, in whoſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Fidelity I entirely confided.</p>
               <p>I don't deny but 'twas ſome trouble to me to think of retiring amongſt Strangers, who though
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59835:74"/>they make Profeſſion of the ſame Religion with me, yet it may be have no more Vertue or Piety than the Reformed in <hi>France:</hi> And I know by ſeveral relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which I had from ſeveral Perſons yet alive, their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>In a Town which I paſſed through in my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, dwelt a good Man of the Reformed Religion, above fourſcore and ten years of Age. I knew him by report, as he alſo knew me, and therefore thought fit to viſit him in my way, and deſire his Advice. If I were of your Age (ſaid he) I would do as you do. I would as carefully flye <hi>France,</hi> as Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do the Coaſts of <hi>Algiers</hi> and <hi>Tunis:</hi> Oh how happy are thoſe that leave an houſe that's full of Cracks, and which every blaſt of wind threatens with ruine.

Than that inſolent Pride, and that cruel perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is acted againſt the Faithful. Aſſure your ſelf, my Son, that one of theſe things hath formerly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Empires, that were more illuſtrious in their beginnings and riſe, than <hi>France</hi> can ever hope to be in the height of its Grandure. Much more reaſon hath a State in which all thoſe three things are ſound, to believe its ruine to be at the Door.</p>
               <p>Theſe words, ſaid the Solitary, pierced my Heart, eſpecially when the good Old Man added this: You know, ſaid he, that the Holy Scripture tells us, that the Judgments of God begin at his
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59835:75"/>own houſe. There's no truth more fully confirmed than this is, by innumerable and moſt Authentick Examples, whereof we have ſeen ſome with our own Eyes. God inflicted his Rod on our Churches in the times of our Fathers, which were miſerably ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaged and deſolated; but when once their T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yal was over, God at length avenged himſelf on their Enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only, on the Heads and Authors of their Miſeries, but alſo on all the People, puniſhing the Children for the Iniquities of their Fa hers. When God had executed his Judgments on his Church in the days of our Anceſtors, who were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Maſſacres and Burnings; he turned his hand againſt our Enemies, and by a juſt Decree we ſaw <hi>France</hi> puniſhed by her ſelf, for the Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhe had committed; and there was no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Town in which Innocent Blood had been ſhed, but was expoſed to the terrible ſtroaks of Plague, War, and Famine, and thoſe who had moſt cryed out againſt the Hugonots, were the firſt that employed their Force and Cruelty againſt their own Country, and at length God caſt theſe Rods of his Anger into the Fire. 'T had been but a ſmall thing if only the Authors of our Miſery had ſuffered, all <hi>France</hi> was involved in the ſame pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, in the ſame Indignation of God.</p>
               <p>Be confident of this, that the Corruption, the Inſolence, and the Perſecution of the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> againſt our Churches, hath a fixed Period, which when it is once come, the long-ſuffering of God will be at an end, and hee'l no longer bear with the Oppreſſors of his Saints, the Blaſphemies of his Name, and the Contemners of his Glory. As for this term which God hath fixed, which muſt expire before hee'l execute his Juſtice, none knows it; for there are ſome Wretches to whom God puts a ſtop in the beginning of their Cariere, and there are others whom he gives a longer ſcope and ſpace,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59835:75"/>and ſeems to have forgotten them, but in the end he will find them, ſo as to render the Vengeance he executes upon them, glorious.</p>
               <p>But not to amuſe my ſelf with Arguments, to prove what I ſay, I exhort you to remember, that every wiſe Man, if he carefully conſider the matter, muſt fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When I had (added the Solitary) taken my leave of my Old Man, whoſe words made ſo great an Impreſſion on my Spirit, that I could not but think on them day and night, I happen'd to loſe my way for want of minding it, and found my ſelf before the mouth of this Cave, into which a hard and long rain forced me to enter, without any other deſ gn but that of ſheltering my ſelf from the Storm. I found in it an honeſt Country-man, who was c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me thither out of the ſame Deſign. He told me ſo many curious things concerning the Cave, that I had a great mind to ſee it, and promiſed him a large recompence if he would accompany me: My offers engaged him, and he immediately returned into the Village where he lived, (which is but a quar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er of a League hence,) and brought back with him ſome Torches, together with a Tinder-box,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59835:76"/>and alſo a line, which if there were any need we might make uſe of, as <hi>Theſeus</hi> did of <hi>Ariadnes</hi> thread.</p>
               <p>With theſe Proviſions we entred the Cave, which we viſited on both ſides, at length he ſhowed me a way where we ſaw the print of mens feet, we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed this track, and by a kind of Private Stairs, which Art aſſiſting Nature had made, we, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny turnings, came to the top of the Rock, which we found open, and ſufficiently light. To this open place there was a door, which being ſhut ſecured it againſt the injuries of the weather: There were alſo other leſs holes, which were beaten out to admit the light, I imagined that this had been the Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſome <hi>Hermite,</hi> that was weary of the world as I were, and had fitted this place for his Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation. The Country-man confirmed me in this Opinion, and told me, that he had heard his Grandfather ſay, That a Man who had the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of great Holineſs had formerly dwelt there.</p>
               <p>Immediately I had a Fancy, which the World it may be will judge ſomewhat extravagant. I reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to try whether I could bear ſuch a kind of Life as the Ancient <hi>Hermites</hi> led: I communicated my Deſign to the Country-man, who in all his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes ſeemed more civil and judicious than ſuch People ordinarily are. I gave him ten Crowns, and conjured him to aſſiſt me; beſides I promiſed him a double or treble Reward for all the pains he ſhould take for me, and he raviſhed with his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, promiſed to do any thing that I ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He preſently apprehended my meaning, and being an Induſtrious Man, returned the next Morning with me to the Cave, where he took meaſure o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Biſhops being enraged that theſe Sheep will not own them, break down the Sheep-fold themſelves, and abandon them to the Wolves, which are the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> who ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to the extreameſt miſery: But theſe Wolves finding no more Sheep to devour, fail upon the Biſhops themſelves and devour them, after having made them ſuffer a million of Evils, which will ſooner or later force them to repent their Cruelty againſt the Reformed, and their having aſſiſted the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in ruining them.</p>
               <p>The ninth Picture ſhowed us a great Crucifix, which was preſented to a multitude of poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who turn'd away their heads from it, that they might neither adore, nor ſo much as look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what they called a ſubject of Idolatry; but as ſoon as ſome Croſſes of Gold and Silver ſtamp't up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>The eleventh Figure ſhowed us an Old Man, with a ſad and diſcontented Countenance, ſitting in his Study. The Solitary told us that 'twas the famous <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>The twelfth Picture repreſented ſomewhat very like to what is written in the ſeventeenth of the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> for we ſaw a Woman holding a Cup in her hand, encompaſſed about with the Kings and Princes of the Earth, and vaſt multitudes of People; ſhe obliged them all to drink of this Cup, which made them quite other Perſons than they were before: Some of them ſeemed to be in an extaſie, others grew ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, ſome grew mad and outragious, all in general
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59835:81"/>forgot their Duty to God, to their Countrey, and to themſelves, acting a thouſand Cruelties againſt the beloved of God; over her head was written theſe words of the Revelations, <hi>This is the Great Whore, with whom the Kings of the Earth have committed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and all the Inhabitants of the Earth have been drunk with the Wine of her Fornication. God hath put it into the hearts of theſe Kings to fulfill her Will, and to agree, and to give their Kingdom to the Beaſt, till the words of God ſhall be fulfilled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Table, ſaid the Solitary, deſerves your mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than any other, both becauſe 'tis taken out of the Holy Scripture, and becauſe we ſee it accompliſhed in our days; but eſpecially I deſire you to conſider the force of theſe words, That ſome of the Kings of the Earth do the pleaſure of the Great Whore, and agree in the ſame thing with her, and give their Kingdom to the Beaſt. I deſire you alſo to examine the <hi>preſent</hi> State of moſt Chriſtian Princes, and you will ſoon be able to judge whether the Revelation be not accompliſhed in this Point.</p>
               <p>There were ſeveral other Figures, which being not finiſhed he did not ſhew us. I ſhall not give you a large Account of our whole Converſation, which would have been much longer than it was, had we not ſeen that the Sun was near ſetting, which obliged us to take our leave of the Solitary, whom we left with a great deal of regrett, who alſo made us promiſe him to make him another viſit. We were ſo taken with his Diſcourſe, that we promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him not only one, but many. Madam <hi>de la Garde</hi> preſſed him with much importunity to ſpend ſome days at her Houſe, where he might be as free as in his Cave; but he conſtantly replyed, That he would never leave his Solitude, till he ſaw an end put to the Perſecution of our Churches.</p>
               <p>At length we parted, and in all our way home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward we diſcourſed of nothing but the rarity of this
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59835:81"/>Adventure, That going to viſit unhabitable Caves, we ſhould there find a Man of Spirit, Worth, Quality and Religion, who had made choice of this dwelling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any other, to enjoy reſt and quiet of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Good God, (ſaid Madam <hi>de la Garde</hi>) to what a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ad condition is <hi>France</hi> reduced at preſent, that men preferr the Solitude of Deſarts and Rocks, before its Towns and Pallaces! We have no reaſon (ſaid I) to wonder at this, ſince in Deſarts, and the Caves of Rocks, we are free from thoſe Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that inflict a thouſand Torments upon us, and are more cruel than wild Beaſts or High-way Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. I am of your Mind, (ſaid Madam <hi>de la Garde</hi>) High-way Robbers are far more merciful and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate than the Gentlemen of the Clergy are to thoſe of the Reformed Religion, whom they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute with the greateſt Fury.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we were engaged in theſe and ſome other Diſcourſes of the ſame nature, we were inſenſibly come to the Caſtle, without perceiving that 'twas Night: As ſoon as I was come out of the Coach, there came one to me that I knew belonged to my Brother, and delivered me a Letter from him. I was ſomewhat ſurprized at this, and he obſerved it, and ſaid, Let not (Madamoiſelle) my Preſence aſtoniſh you, for I bring you no News but what is good. I opened the Letter, and found that 'twas only a Letter of Credit, by which my Brother or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me to hear all that this Man ſhould ſay. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately I took him aſide in a lower Chamber, where he ſatisfied my Curioſity, by giving me an Account of all that happened at our Houſe, after my carrying away, which my Brother had not time to do.</p>
               <p>Seeing you deſire it, Madamoiſelle, ſaid he, I ſhall give you as brief a Relation as I can of all that happened. I was with Monſieur <hi>de Ponſins</hi> my Maſter when he came to the Caſtle. He immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately

               <p>Monſieur <hi>de Ponſins</hi> having written this Letter in the height of his Paſſion, when he ſcarce knew what he did himſelf, gave it to me, commanding me to deliver it to Madam <hi>d' Ombreval,</hi> and carefully to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her Countenance in the reading of it: For there were ſome private Conſiderations which made him reſolve not to carry me with him. I faithfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged my truſt, though I had but too juſt reaſon to fear being miſchiev'd by it. I went into Madam <hi>d' Ombreval</hi> s Chamber as ſoon as my Maſter had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Horſe, who found Monſieur <hi>de Haute Cour</hi> at the Caſtle Gate, having his Heart full of joy in hopes to ſee you, but had like to have dyed in the place as ſoon as he heard of what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen you. Monſieur <hi>de Ponſins</hi> comforted him the beſt that he could, and told him that he was going to purſue your Raviſhers, having a certain knowledge of the way they took: This word ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what revived him, and cauſed him to ſuſpend his Grief, to give place to his Fury.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Madam <hi>d' Ombreval</hi> read her Sons invective with Eyes that ſparkled with Rage. Traytor, (ſaid ſhe to me) Haſt thou had the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to be the Bearer of what I have read? I believe, Madam, anſwered I, that I have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no great fault in obeying my Maſter, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering you a Letter from him, in which there can be nothing but what is conformable to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he hath for you. She look't upon me with a ſevere Countenance, and anſwered nothing: I made her a profound reverence and withdrew. In the mean time I knew that ſhe had ſent for Monſieur <hi>Abelard,</hi> who was an underſtanding Man, and able to give good Advice, and that ſhe had ſhown the Letter to him. Could you have imagined (ſaid ſhe) that this Traytor <hi>de Ponſins</hi> would have dealt thus with me? Hath he not offended me more than if he had given me a thouſand Stabs at the Heart?</p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:59835:83"/>
               <p>I confeſs, Madam, (anſwered he,) he hath much violated the reſpect he owed you. But what will not the juſt Grief of ſeeing a Siſter carried into a Convent by force, utterly againſt her Inclination, cauſe a Man to do? Ah Madam, thoſe that adviſed you to ſuch an Action, little minded what reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the World would make on it, nor how much your Reputation would ſuffer by it. I ſee, ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>d' Ombreval,</hi> that you are one of <hi>de Ponſins</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers. No, replyed he, I am not, God keep me from approving of his Carriage towards you, 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry culpable. Yet Madam, I have not ſuch baſe complaiſance, to commend the Violence which hath been acted againſt your Daughter, nor your follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Advice of ſuch a Perſon as no one hath a good Opinion of but your ſelf. What would you have men ſay of the influence he hath on you, ſo as to make you become unnatural? I know you'l tell me, that 'tis your Zeal that hath made you act this; but can any Zeal authorize Violence? What cenſure will the World paſs on you, when it hears that Madam <hi>d' Ombreval</hi> hath cauſed her Daughter to be hurried into a Convent, obliged her Son to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>andon all, and that a Jeſuit is become abſolute Lord over her Mind, and in her Caſtle?</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>d' Ombreval</hi> attentively heard <hi>Abelards</hi> Diſcourſe, and ſeemed affected with his Reaſons, not returning one word of Anſwer, which encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged him to proceed. You have, Madam, been highly eſteemed by all the World, during the Life of Monſieur <hi>d' Ombreval.</hi> Alas, ſhall it be ſaid that this Eſteem is buried with your Husband; and that you your ſelf have caſt it into the ſame Grave with his Bones? Have you well conſidered that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe and anguiſh which muſt neceſſarily follow what you have done? for I foreſee that Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle <hi>de St. Poale</hi> ſeeing her ſelf forced into a Cloyſter, will in a ſhort time dye for Grief. As
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59835:84"/>for Mounſier <hi>de Ponſins,</hi> he will not ſail to find what I'm ſure he will go to ſeek: Thus you'l be at once deprived of two Children, who have all the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments that you can wiſh. After their Deaths what will become of Monſieur <hi>d Ombrevals</hi> and your Eſtate? without doubt the Jeſuites will have it, who have a long time thirſted after this prev. And if the Father <hi>Matthew</hi> were a Man that would give Glory to God, and confeſs the Truth, it would ſoon appear that his ſole end in adviſing you to do what you have done, was to cauſe your Eſtate to fall into the hands of that Society.</p>
               <p>Though Monſieur <hi>Abelard</hi> ſpake only at random, yet he chanced to hit upon the Truth. Madam <hi>d' Ombreval</hi> anſwered him very coldly, If I were not, ſaid ſhe, aſſured of your Affection to me and my Family, I ſhould think that you delighted to vex me. If what I have ſaid, anſwered <hi>Abelard,</hi> hath offended you, I am ready to withdraw, after having begged your Pardon. But Madam, (added he) methinks it ſeems very hard and uncouth to ſee you here alone without the Children wherewith God hath bleſſed you, and whom he hath left you to be your Comfort after the ſenſible Affliction of your Husbands Death. People will be apt to ſay that you delight to afflict your ſelf, making your ſelf the Inſtrument of your Childrens Perſecution.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Abelard,</hi> replyed Madam your Mother, what would you have had me to have done? My Son had ſeduced my Daughter, who was become more than half an Hugonot: According to the Maxims of our Church, I believed that being a Hugonot ſhe would be damn'd, I was deſirous to ſecure her Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: And ſince ſhe would not be reduced by Arguments, (her Brother having ſo prejudiced her Mind, that that Method could have no effect upon her,) I ſent her into a Convent, where I am much deceived if they do not in time ſurmount her Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59835:84"/>Madam, ſaid <hi>Abelard,</hi> I am a good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and therefore you have no reaſon to ſuſpect me; but I aſſure you, if Madamoiſelle <hi>de St. Phale</hi> be forced to return to the Catholick Religion, ſhe will be as lyable to Damnation as if ſhe had always lived in the Profeſſion of the pretended Reformed Religion; for I am not ſo ignorant as not to know, that God requires an hearty, free, and voluntary, and not a forced Service. When he had ſaid thus, he withdrew, to give Madam <hi>d' Ombreval</hi> opportunity to conſider what he had ſaid.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>d' Ombreval</hi> was touched by nothing more ſenſibly than what concerned her Honour, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> which ſhe was always very tender. She now pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nly law, that never imagining any hurt, ſhe had been drawn by her Confeſſor into ſuch Actions, as expoſed her to the cenſure of idle and malicious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erſons. She could not conceal her Sentiments from <hi>Abelard,</hi> whom ſhe cauſed to come into her Chamber the next day, to give her ſome Advice, I can adviſe you nothing, ſaid he, but to call home your Children. But how can I do that, ſaid Madam <hi>d' Ombreval,</hi> my Daughter it may be is at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent entred into a Convent, and my Son, where ſhall I ſend to ſeek him? Beſides, ſhould I find him, I know not whether he would return or no, and how can I ſuffer him in my fight after ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious a Letter as he hath written me. Ah Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid he, I am ſure hee'l beg your Pardon with all his Heart, if we were once ſo happy as to have him here. As for Madamoiſelle your Daughter, they'l ſend her back as ſoon as you ſhall deſire it, Write but one word to the Convent, and they'll not fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l of contenting you in this matter.</p>
               <p>In this Conjuncture there happened ſomewhat that had a great Influence on Madam <hi>d' Ombrevals</hi> embracing more favourable Sentiments, than thoſe ſhe formerly had, which was a long and dangerous
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59835:85"/>Sickneſs of the Father <hi>Matthew,</hi> which hindered him from returning to the Caſtle. On the other hand, Madam your Mother, for fear of giving the World occaſion to reflect on her, never ſo much as ſent to enquire how he did. Nor did ſhe manifeſt all her diſpleaſure againſt him, for having abuſed the deference ſhe had for his Advice, by drawing into ſuch Inconveniencies as he had done. She went once into your Brothers Chamber, and ſeeing a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on the Table, ſhe opened it, and happened to lite on that place where <hi>David</hi> bewailing his Son <hi>Abſalom,</hi> cryed out, <hi>O Abſalom my Son, my Son Abſalom.</hi> This paſſage ſuited her condition, and made her ſay, <hi>O Ferdinand my Son, my Son Ferdinand.</hi> I was at that time with her, and ſaw her ſhed tears in abundance.</p>
               <p>At length ſhe turned towards me, and ſaid, Thou knoweſt <hi>Mark</hi> where thy Maſter is. Yes Madam, ſaid I. And wherefore didſt thou not go with him? Becauſe (anſwered I) he left me behind him to take care of ſuch things as he carried not with him. Wouldſt thou not do better (added ſhe) in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him back? You have, ſaid I, more power over him than I, and you know what 'twas that drove him hence: I ſpake theſe words with ſome confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which ſhe perceiving, asked me why I was troubled: Becauſe (ſaid I) my Maſter was under ſuch deſperate Grief at his departure, that if he finds not an opportunity to end his days, his Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly is of it ſelf enough to bring him to his Grave, which if it happen, I ſhall loſe the beſt of Maſters, and you, Madam, the moſt perfect and accompliſh't of all Sons.</p>
               <p>Thy Maſter hath grievouſly offended me, and I know not whether it be poſſible to abuſe a Mother more than he hath done me, in the Letter which he commanded thee to deliver me. I ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be aſtoniſhed at this. My Innocence (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſhe) together with the purity of mine Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59835:85"/>bear me witneſs, for which reaſon I am not ſo much offended as it may be I ſhould have been, were I not juſtified by mine own Conſcience. I wiſh (ſaid I) that my Maſter were here, I am ſure he would begg your Pardon with all imaginable humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſorrow for what he hath done. And I, (ſaid ſhe) would pardon him with all my Heart, ſince 'tis tenderneſs for his Siſter was the cauſe of his offence.</p>
               <p>Madam your Mother after ſhe had ſaid theſe words, left her Chamber, and went into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, where I ſaw her walk all alone in much pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs. 'Twas much otherwiſe with her now, than when ſhe uſed to walk there with Monſieur <hi>d' Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breval,</hi> and to converſe chearfully with her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the remembrance of which filled her heart with ſuch cruel Anguiſh, that ſhe could not conceal it from Monſieur <hi>Abelard,</hi> who came to ſee her. But Madam, ſaid he, if it ſhall pleaſe God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore you your Children, may they promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to live ſecurely with you without fear? And ſhall the Father <hi>Matthew</hi> no more move you to torment thoſe whom you have born in your Womb; whom you cannot deal illy with, without violating the ſtricteſt Laws of Nature? If their Religion differ from yours, how can you help it? Know, (Madam) that in matters of Religion, the more you endeavour to force a Generous Spirit, ſuch as Madamoiſelle's your Daughters is, the further is it from yielding to ſuch force. I promiſe you (ſaid ſhe) that ſhe ſhall enjoy all imaginable peace, and if I deal o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe with her, I give you leave to account me the moſt inhumane of all Mothers.</p>
               <p>I cannot promiſe you, ſaid he, that ſhe will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, yet I dare hope it. After ſome other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, <hi>Abelard</hi> withdrew. This was the fifth day after my Maſter left us, to go to your Aſſiſtance. This Evening when it was near Night, he came
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59835:86"/>to <hi>Ponſins,</hi> and went to <hi>Abelard</hi>'s Houſe, who gave him an account of the Affairs of the Caſtle, and of what he had done, and alſo of the ſeaſonable ſickneſs of the Father <hi>Matthew.</hi> Monſieur <hi>d' Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breval</hi> alſo related the Hiſtory of your Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and how you were retired hither, where you reſolved to abide, 'till you could take other Meaſures. Hereupon they conſulted together what Courſe was fit to be taken, and at length 'twas reſolved that my Brother ſhould write a Letter to Mounſieur <hi>Abelard,</hi> to order me immediately to bring him his Habiliments for War, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected two Leagues off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abelard</hi> carried this Billet to your Mother, who ſaid to him, let him come hither, tell him that I would ſpeak with him before he takes an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Farewell of me, after which he may do what he pleaſeth. Ah Madam, (ſaid he) he is but an Hours riding hence, I'le bring him to you this Night. Immediately he returned to his Houſe, where they ſupt together, and after Supper they went to the Caſtle; but 'twas very late before they came thither, and Madam your Mother expected them with a great deal of Impatience.</p>
               <p>She had a great mind to ſhow her ſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what cold and ſevere; but the affecting manner in which Mounſier <hi>d' Ombreval</hi> threw himſelf at her Feet, and embraced them, without being able to ſpeak a word, awakened the Voice of Nature in her, in compariſon of which all other Voices are weak and impotent. Ah <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> (ſaid ſhe, raiſing him up,) I only deſired to ſee you, to hear you condemn your ſelf with your own mouth. I deſire no other Judge but your own Conſcience. I might (ſaid he) find ſomewhat to plead in my juſtification, but Madam, I had rather make a ſincere Confeſſion of my fault. But <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> (ſaid Madam <hi>d' Ombreval</hi>) if I cauſe your Siſter
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59835:86"/>to return, and leave her in a full and perfect Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, will not this ſatisfie you? for I ſee that the great love you have for her, cauſeth you to fail in the reſpect you owe me.</p>
               <p>Mounſier <hi>d' Ombreval</hi> ſeemed ſatisfied with this Promiſe, yet he ſtill remained ſilent. Ah! (ſaid Madam your Mother) I know <hi>Ferdinand</hi> what 'tis that you are afraid of; you are afraid leaſt I ſhould alter my mind, but for this you may ſet your Heart at reſt, and know, that though the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mathew</hi> were not ſick unto Death, yet he hath cauſed me too many troubleſome Nights ever to make uſe of his Advice again: I know what Venom there is in all his Counſels, and I ſwear I'le never follow them more; I ſwear this in truth, and in ſicerity of Heart; and what is more, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to follow no Advice but yours and your Siſters.</p>
               <p>Seeing 'tis thus, replyed my Maſter, I ſhall free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſs that my Siſter is delivered, and I ſhould have brought her with me, could I have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo favourable an Entertainment. Hereupon my Maſter gave her an Account of the whole ſucceſs of your Adventure, at which ſhe ſeemed extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed, and deſired to ſee you as ſoon as ſhe could. Immediately ſhe abandoned her Soul to Joy, and would needs have a Collation with her Son before ſhe went to Bed, who ſatisfied her as to all the demands ſhe made, except thoſe as required a more certain Aſſurance, that ſhe would continue in this good temper. My Maſter hath now ſent me hither to give you an Account of all that paſſed, that your mind may be in quiet, leaſt the uncertain Condition of your Affairs ſhould diſturb it.</p>
               <p>Here ended the Relation which my Brothers Servant made, whom I diſmiſs'd; after which I went to ſee Madam <hi>de la Garde</hi> and her two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59835:87"/>Daughters, who rejoyced exceedingly at the happy ſucceſs of my Affairs, for which we heartily bleſſed God. I had a great mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home to my Mother, but Madam <hi>de la Garde</hi> adviſed me not to make too much haſte; add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I would do well to make my entrance into the Reformed Church before my return. I'le lend you my Caſtle, (ſaid ſhe) and I have a Miniſter in whom we may confide, and we will have no other Witneſſes to the Action but my ſelf, my two Sons in Law, and their Wives, my Daughters. I thanked her, and ſaid, that I would not engage her in an Affair whoſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences might prove fatal to her; but ſhe would not be put off. Daughter (ſaid ſhe) we are every hour in danger of Death, make uſe of the opportunity you have to make your Declaration, a time may come when you may exceedingly regret your having let it ſlip. At length I yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her Reaſons, and we reſolved that the Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following ſhould be the day for this Work. As for the place, we choſe a Summer-houſe that was in the Garden. And the Miniſter being before adviſed of it, came at the day appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>He was a Man of about fifty Years of Age, of a good Carriage: He deſired to Diſcourſe me in private. I gave him an account of what made me deſire to enter into the Communion of the Reformed, at which he ſeemed ſatisfied, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I had been pretty well Inſtructed. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this we went all into the Garden, which was very large and ſpacious, the Doors of which we carefully ſhut, for fear of being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>er ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed or interrupted, and went into the Summer-houſe, as we had deſigned. The firſt thing our Miniſter did, was to Pray in general for our lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Aſſembly, after which he made a Diſcourſe,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59835:87"/>ſhort indeed, but very full and affecting, of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eceſſity of Converſion, and of being ſincere, and perſevering in it. When he had finiſhed this Diſcourſe, he addreſſed himſelf particularly to me, in theſe Words:</p>
               <p>There's no great need (Madamoiſelle) that I ſhould repreſent theſe things to you, or be more large in them. Know that the Work we are about is of ſuch great moment, that 'tis inferiour to none other in the World. You abandon a Church that is inviron'd with Pomp and Magnificence, and is ſupported by almoſt all thoſe that are great and powerful; a Church that hath under it many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Tongues and Nations, which boaſts of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and is at preſent more flouriſhing than ever: This Church (I ſay) you abandon, to enter into another, in which you will ſee nothing but miſery, reproach and grief, whoſe Members are accounted the filth and off-ſcouring of all things, and are but very few, in compariſon of thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> A Church that is charged with Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Innovation, and which is in a word op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and deſolated at preſent more than ever hitherto it hath been. I ask you once more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſmall and holy Aſſembly, Have you well conſidered what you do? Hath no humane Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or worldly Conſideration obliged you to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Belief in which you were born and bred, to embrace another?</p>
               <p>This Queſtion, for which I was not prepared, thinking I had fully ſatisfied the Miniſter in our private Converſation, ſomewhat ſurprized me, yet I took Courage, and riſing up, returned this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. I call God to witneſs before you, God (I ſay) who knows the ſecrets of my heart, and to whom my moſt concealed Deſigns are all open and naked, that I forſake the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59835:88"/>it hath fallen into many fundamental Errors with reſpect to Faith: And becauſe I am ſenſible that I cannot coutinue in it without putting my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation on a deſperate hazard. This is the ſole, the only Motive of my Change, nothing of any private grudge or worldly affection prompting me to it. I will alſo, and I freely conſent that you all ſhould riſe up as witneſſes againſt me at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the moſt ſecret imaginations of our hearts ſhall be diſcovered, if my Converſion be not ſincere, or if any worldly Paſſion hath moved me to it.</p>
               <p>I need not tell you what I ſhall loſe in the world by abandoning the Roman Religion, nor yet the Miſeries I muſt expect in embracing the Reformed. I have made divers Reflections upon it for a long time, and God hath given me Grace to ſurmount all the allorements of the world, and the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I have reaſon to expect in entring into the Communion of Saints. I ſhall only ſay, that this Proſperity, and thoſe delights that are in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have diſguſted me, and made me fear to remain in it; for I remember the inſtructions of my Father, That it would be with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in general, as we ſee 'tis with the wicked in particular, God ſuffers them to be advanced and to triumph on the Earth, to render that ruine and fall that will ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly overtake them, the more dreadful. I am not ſo ignorant as not to know, that all thoſe delights and this Pomp of the Romiſh Church, is a mark of its being a falſe Church, ſeeing theſe things leads men voluntarily to Eternal Miſery.

               <p>I made my Declaration to the Miniſter before I came hither, of all the abuſes which I found in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> I now reject them all, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to adhere to the Faith of that Church which is the true Spouſe of Chriſt, particularly to the Faith of the Reformed Churches of <hi>France,</hi> without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to or taking from it, or changing it in any particular; and in this Faith I deſire to dye, and I truſt in the Mercy of God, that having begun a good

               </p>
               <p>Here I ended my Diſcourſe, to which the Paſtor returned this Anſwer: Madamoiſelle, ſaid he, I have heard you with a great deal of Joy, as alſo have thoſe good Chriſtians that are here preſent. And how can there chuſe but be joy on Earth, ſeeing there's Joy in Heaven when a Sinner repents, or a Wanderer is reduced into the right way? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſwaded therefore that your Converſion is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and real, <q>In the Name, and by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Lord, I declare you a true Member of his Church. He hath choſen you from Eternity to be his, and as ſuch he hath called you Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by his Word, and more effectually by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; ſo that I only publiſh and make known to men, what God hath done for you.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You are now entred into a path very thorny, but withal very glorious; you ſhall ſuffer all the days of your Life, but at length you ſhall finiſh your days in peace and Joy: You muſt encounter with innumerable Enemies, but the iſſue of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate will be your Glory and Triumph. The God of Mercy, who deſires not the Death of a Sinner, but rather that he would repent and live, increaſe in you all the Gifts of his Holy Spirit, and ſuſtain you with his Power from on high, that having in this World received Authentick Evidences of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, he may indeed beſtow it upon you in the Heavens.</p>
               <p>Conſider ſeriouſly, that having entred into this way of Eternal Life, you muſt not draw back, nor ſo much as look back, by remembring and regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your paſt Grandure, and Conveniencies: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you abandon all things to follow the Lord
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59835:89"/>Jeſus, you cannot, with a good Conſcience return to what you have left, without commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an outrage on him, and alienating your heart from the Lord of Glory, who abhorrs a divided heart, an heart that pretends to adhere to him, and at the ſame time runs out after the World: <hi>Little Children,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John, love not the world, neither the things that are in the world, if any man love the world, the Love of the Father is not in him.</hi> Oh how happy is that Soul, who forſaking all other things, makes the Lord Jeſus Chriſt his ſupream happineſs, his All! Having ſaid thus, he prayed again for me with much fervour and affection, during which I ſhed a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand tears of Joy, the Evidences of an inward joy and ſatisfaction. Madam <hi>de la Garde</hi> and her two Daughters wept alſo, and her Sons-in-law were much affected: This Action was concluded with ſinging the 85th. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which begins thus.</p>
               <q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Oh Lord our God, thou gracious</l>

               <p>This was followed by the Bleſſing, in which I as a New Commer had a double Portion.

               <p>I could not chuſe but bluſh at the hearing of ſuch News, eſpecially in the preſence of Monſieur <hi>de Haute-Cour,</hi> who ſoon perceived the Confuſion I was under, and took this opportunity to fall at my feet, and to tell me, that although his Paſſion had been approved of by my late Father, though it was authorized by my Brother; and though he had alſo obtain'd the conſent of my Mother, yet he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to owe me to none but my ſelf. I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (ſaid I) any averſion from you, nor am I ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ever having it: You are an honeſt man, much eſteemed by all, you have much Merit and Worth, nor am I abſolutely blind. Moreover, you have for you, the Conſent of my Father, of my Mother, and of a Brother whom I am obliged by many reaſons to Honour and Love. He loves Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59835:92"/>your Siſter beyond expreſſion; I give you leave to draw what favourable conſequences you pleaſe out of all theſe things, and remember that this is the ſecond time that you have forced me to declare the ſentiments of my heart, though they were not unknown to you; beware, (ſaid I ſmiling) you do it not a third time, leaſt you give me juſt cauſe to complain of you.</p>
               <p>Ah Siſter, ſaid my Brother laughing, you would make us believe (did we not know you well enough) that you were worſe than indeed you are. I could not chuſe but laugh in my turn, and to break off a Converſation ſo little ſerious, I entred upon a Diſcourſe of my return. Monſieur <hi>de Haute-Cour</hi> could not conſent to it, being ſtill afraid on my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. But my Brother was for it, declaring that he would take ſuch care, and keep-ſuch a ſtrict watch over all paſſages, that they ſhould never be able to play me ſuch a trick as they had done. For my part I deſired it with all my heart, and told them, that ſeeing my Mother was hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Immediately we all three left the Chamber to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn Madam <hi>de la Garde,</hi> to whom we diſcovered the reſult of our Conſultation: She conſented with ſome difficulty, fearing the ſame things that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Haute-Cour</hi> did. But my Brother aſſured her that ſhe had no reaſon to fear, ſeeing Father <hi>Mathew</hi> was under diſgrace, and beſides was ſick unto Death, which hindered him from regaining the Empire he had once over my Mothers Spirit. We ſupt this Evening very chearfully, and ſate up till it was near Morning, ſpending the time in a thouſand innocent Diverſions, at length each withdrew to his Chamber to take ſome hours rei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Methinks, ſaid Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Haute-Cour,</hi> after the uſage you have met with at the Caſtle <hi>de Ponſins,</hi> you ſhould not be ſo earneſt to return to it. Methinks, Monſieur, anſwered I, there is nothing more glorious than to return with Honour to a place from whence we have been ſhamefully driven, when thoſe who have driven us away, are forced by their own remorſe to do us juſtice, and Careſs us a thouſand ways, to make us forget the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries we have received at their hands.</p>
               <p>Juſt as I had ſpoken theſe words, came Madam <hi>de la Garde</hi> into the Chamber, which prevented Monſieur <hi>de Haute-Cour</hi> from making any reply. Why Daughter, (ſaid ſhe) are you in ſuch haſte to be gone from me? at leaſt ſpend this day with us. Ah! Madam, (anſwered I) ſhould I follow the Inclinations of my heart, I ſhould not only ſpend this day, but my whole Life with you. 'Tis in this Houſe that I have made my entrance into the Church of the Lord, and my open profeſſion of true Chriſtianity: But Madam, I have a Mother to whom I am obliged not only by Blood and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but alſo by a thouſand unexpreſſible tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: She is ſick, ſhe deſires to ſee me, I muſt they her in all things in which Conſcience is not concern'd.

My dear Daughter (ſaid ſhe) I admire the fatality of this Adventure; 'twas but a few days ſince that I firſt knew you, and yet I love you as tenderly as I can poſſibly love my own Daughters, which are my own Fleſh and Blood, yet the ſame Fate that hath drawn out my Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions towards you, ſnatches you from me now, when I moſt deſire your Preſence. We muſt obey, and ſubmit our ſelves to Gods Will. All things concur in calling you home to a Mother that loves you, and I will not diſſwade you from your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet I would as a Mother, and as a Member of the ſame Society with you, give you ſome Advice, which as Affairs are at preſent, cannot but be uſeful to you.</p>
               <p>Conſider Daughter, that you are a Member of the true Chriſtian Church, and that this quality of <hi>Reformed</hi> Chriſtian, obligeth you to renounce all the Pleaſures of the World, which ordinarily follow greatneſs, and ſeem to be entailed on the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I ſhall not inſiſt much on this Point, becauſe by what I know of you, you are too wiſe and Prudent not to make this reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſelf: Yet there is another Point on which I have ſpoken to you already, and ſhall now ſpeak what more God hath put into my mind; 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your Conſtancy, to ſhew you, that having embraced the Truth, you are obliged to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in it to the end, with an invincible firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>It hath been obſerved, and the Obſervation is confirmed by daily expe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59835:93"/>of God teacheth us, the Devil and the World ſeem to be let looſe againſt that Perſon; God ſuffers him to be expoſed to the ſharpeſt Tryals, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his Iniquity and Hypocriſie, if he return again into the falſe Church: Whereas the true Children of God, having their Duty always before their Eyes, never fail in ſo eſſential a Point as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance is, but continue in the fear of the Lord unto the end. Thus you ſee that the ſame fire of Perſecution, the ſame Furnace of Afflictions ſhow the difference that there is between the Gold and the Droſs that is found with it, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo well diſtinguiſhed when they are both taken out of the Mines together.

               <p>There have been Perſons of Honour and Merit that have alſo been obliged to ſeek ſecurity amongſt the <hi>Reformed</hi> of other Countreys; but alas! they were

               <p>I ſpeak theſe things that you may not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized nor aſtoniſhed, when you ſee the Lives of ſome of the Reformed, ſo different from their Faith, and that you may not take up an ill Opinion of what they believe from their Practices, by which they are ſo far from honouring the Father which is in Heaven, that they not only diſhonour him them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but alſo by their horrible Examples pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke others to do ſo too.

               <p>As ſoon as theſe things were over, we went to Dinner, at which we were not ſo chearful as we had been laſt Night at Supper. After Dinner we took our leaves one of another. I ſhall not give an account of the Tears we all ſhed: I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have thought 'twould have been ſo terrible to me to part from Madam <hi>de la Garde</hi> and her two illuſtrious Daughters, who alſo made me Preſents after their Mothers Example. They all went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Coach to keep me Company; the Meſſieurs <hi>d' Arbaux</hi> and <hi>de Chables</hi> took Horſe to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny my Brother and Lover, who came on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, though they alſo brought a Coach with them. They rode with us about a League and half where freſh Tears were ſhed by us, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Civilities paſſed between our Gentlemen. My Brother and Lover made their Compliments in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to Madam <hi>de la Garde</hi> and her two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, becauſe of their extraordinary kindneſs they had ſhown me; and after varieties of Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons denoting thankfulneſs and affection, our Coaches parted: I was left in mine with none but my Chamber-maid, admiring the ſtrange revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this World, that I ſhould return volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the ſame way which I had been but a little before carried by force. As for my Lover and my Brother, they choſe to ride on Horſe-back, for
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59835:95"/>fear of any unhappy accident; they had alſo with them two Men that were very reſolute and well armed.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not give you an account of what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened this Journey, 'till I come to our Caſtle. My Brother cauſed the Coach to ſtop ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Gate, becauſe he would not have my Mother know by the noiſe that we were come. My Brother and Lover alighted off their Horſes, and I came out of the Coach; and my Brother having ſtrictly charged all the Family not to give my Mother Notice of our coming, we went up towards her Chamber, and I met her coming out of her Cloſet, with an extream pale and languiſhing Countenance, at which I was much ſurprized: As ſoon as I ſaw her, I fell at her feet, ſaving, God hath been very gracious to me, in ſuffering me to embrace your Knees with the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction I have of being aſſured that you are no longer angry with me. At this ſurprize my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cryed out, and was forced to ſit down, not having ſtrength to ſtand up; at length being a little come to her ſelf, ſhe ſaid, <hi>Juſtine,</hi> my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! <hi>Juſtine,</hi> my Child! Let me ſay, that God hath been very gracious to me, in reſtoring me my dear Children, after I had blindly taken ſuch pains to drive them from me: Come, my Daughter, let me embrace you, after which let Death come when it will, I am ready for it.</p>
               <p>I would not ſtir from her Knees, but ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me to ariſe and ſit down by her. The Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment was ſo great, that ſhe took no notice of Mounſier <hi>de Haute-Cour</hi> nor my Brother: At length, I believe, (ſaid ſhe to the former) that your Happineſs hath been the ſole hindrance of my Daughters Miſery, for Heaven would not ſuffer a Perſon dear to you, to be carried away, but hath directed you to find her and bring her back. In a word, Heaven hath
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59835:96"/>deſtin'd her for you, and men can neither ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully nor honeſtly oppoſe its Decrees. You told me a few days ſince, that you deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World more than to have her for your Wife. I now give her to you, and both Command her as a Mother, and begg her as a Friend to conſider you as her Husband, ſeeing Mounſieur <hi>de Roche-Blanche,</hi> and Madam his Wife, her dead Father, and her Brother, by whom ſhe ought to be directed ſince her Fathers death, have deſired this Union.</p>

I did ſo, and God at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined me to do what I have now done, for which I do, and I hope I ſhall to all Eternity bleſs his Holy Name. Beſides, my Brother gave me a New Teſtament, which I read ſeveral times, and we had ſome Diſcourſes together, till at length the Spirit of God finiſhed the work he had begun in me. Take, Madam, the ſame Courſe, and be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that the reaſon why your Prieſts and Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors forbid you to read the Holy Scriptures, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its exceeding great light is abundantly ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to diſcover all their Errors and Abuſes. Indeed (replyed my Mother) the words that you have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken are very wonderful: <hi>To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your heart.</hi> Yes, Madam, (ſaid I) you'l find it thus written in the 94th or 95th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where <hi>David</hi> exhorts his People not to reſiſt the Voice and Will of God, if they hear him ſpeaking to their hearts or to their Eyes by his wonderful Works. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the third Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> applies this paſſage to thoſe to whom God had diſcovered the firſt ſparks of his Truth, either by his Word heard or meditated on, or by holy ſpeculations, for theſe things are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Voice of God; ſo that none can harden their Hearts againſt it, without becoming guilty in his ſight.</p>
               <p>If you pleaſe, Madam, (added I) I'll fetch you the New Teſtament which my Brother gave me. Do ſo; (ſaid ſhe) and if you ſee Monſieur <hi>de Haute-Cour</hi> bid him come hither, for I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal our Converſation from him. I went, or rather
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59835:97"/>flew, to diſcharge the Commiſſion my Mother had given me. I called my Lover, to whom I gave a brief account of the diſpoſition of my Mothers Spirit; I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>egg'd his aſſiſtance in perſwading her, which he joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully promiſed; ſo that we went both to her. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur, (ſaid my Mother) you cannot but be ſenſible of the Eſteem and Affection that I have for you. I deſire that you would ſincerely tell me your Mind, without the leaſt complaiſance: My Daughter hath confeſſed, that ſhe is of the ſame Religion that you are. For my part, I neither love nor value her the leſs for it; and ſometimes I am apt to approve of what ſhe hath done, and believe, that had I been in her circumſtances I ſhould have done the ſame thing. In a word, the farther I look into it, the more abuſes I diſcover in the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion; but yet I know not what to do, for we ought not to abandon a Belief in which we have been born and bred, unleſs very weighty Reaſons oblige us to it; nor yet can we perſevere in a belief whoſe falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood we are convinced of, without wounding our Conſcience. Theſe Conſiderations keep my mind in ſuſpence; pray help me to determine what courſe to take.</p>
               <p>Madam, (replyed Monſieur <hi>de Haute-Cour,</hi>) ſince 'tis your pleaſure that I ſpeak my thoughts freely, I ſhall not amuſe my ſelf by diſcourſing largely on the Truth and Purity of the Reformed Religion, nor the Errors of that of <hi>Rome,</hi> for this would be a work of ſome hours, yea of ſome days. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> errs in many fundamental poynts, and the Arguments ſhe urgeth in her defence are ſo weak and captious, that I ſhould never have done, ſhould I give you a particular account of them. I ſhall therefore turn my Diſcourſe another way, and prove that you have no reaſon to make any difficulty of leaving the Romiſh Religion, ſince
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59835:98"/>thoſe very Perſons that preſs you to perſevere in it, are not themſelves perſwaded of its truth.</p>

I ſhall not inſiſt on this, that this kind of Confeſſion is not to be found in Scripture, without offering abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Violence to it, and that if the Primitive Church ever admitted it, 'twas never accounted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly neceſſary, as 'tis now. What need is there, (Madam) that a Prieſt ſhould know all my Heart, and diſcover all my weakneſſes, fears and ſcruples, whereby he may do what he will with me, eſpecially drain my Eſtate to enrich Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and Monaſteries?

Who ſees not that this is nothing elſe but a meer humane Invention? for Purgatory was invented to cauſe ſhe <hi>Maſs</hi> to be prized, and the <hi>Maſs</hi> to furniſh the Kitchin; whence it follows, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invented, to furniſh the Clergy with means to live in pomp and deliciouſneſs. This hath occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned many <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks to laugh at Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and contemn the Maſs, adhering only external<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion for their advantage, but indeed are of no Religion at all, becauſe they judge that all Religions are like the <hi>Roman,</hi> invented only to awe the People, and keep them in due bounds, as more effectual to this End, than Arms and Cittadells.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Maſs,</hi> did we but know the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Prieſts that laugh at it in their Hearts, it may be the hundredth part of all the Prieſts in the World would hardly be found good <hi>Catholicks.</hi> Did they believe that Chriſt was really preſent, and that they could bring him down from Heaven to eat him, they would behave themſelves far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the celebration of the Maſs than now they do. Not one of them but would tremble, knowing that he held in his hands Chriſt the Son of God, God and Man, the Monarch of Angels, he that ſhall judge him at the laſt day, and could puniſh him immediately for his offences againſt him. They would neither be what they are, nor do what they
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59835:99"/>do, if they were perſwaded that they held the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World in their hands, who is jealous of his own Glory. In a word, (added Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle <hi>de St. Phale</hi>) Monſieur <hi>de Haute-Cour</hi> ſaid the ſame things for ſubſtance that Monſieur <hi>de B. V.</hi> ſaid the other day againſt the Father <hi>Maimbourge,</hi> who undertook to defend the Prohibition the King had made, That no Catholick ſhould turn Proteſtant; and that ſuch as had formerly been Proteſtants, and had turned Catholicks, ſhould not return to their firſt profeſſion, of which Prohibition or Declaration Monſieur <hi>de B. V.</hi> ſhewed the horrible Injuſtice and Abuſe.</p>
               <p>My Mother hearkened very attentively to what Monſieur <hi>de Haute-Cour</hi> ſaid. Indeed he made his Reflections in ſo curious and ſweet a manner, and with ſo much ſtrength of Judgment, that ſhe heard him without interrupting him at all. We had eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day Diſcourſes of this Nature, till at length I perceived my Mother was more than half conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when I ſaw all the Images that were in her Chamber removed and laid up in a Garret, inſtead whereof ſhe ordered my Fathers Bible with <hi>Lio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> and <hi>Deſmarets</hi> Annotations to be brought her, in which I very often read to her. Monſieur <hi>de Haute-Cour</hi> expounded ſeveral paſſages, and ſhewed her what was believed and practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> contrary to the Scripture.</p>
               <p>On a certain day as we were all together, ſhe took up my New Teſtament, and read the words which my Brother had wrote in the beginning: <hi>Behold I ſtand at the door at knock, if any one hear my voice and open to me, I will come in unto him, and ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> Do you know, Madam, ſaid Monſieur <hi>de Haute-Cour,</hi> what Chriſt means, when he ſaith that <hi>he ſtands at the Door and knocks?</hi> He doth this when he toucheth an Heart, as he hath done yours, when he makes it know by frequent
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59835:99"/>admonitions, that is muſt come to him. Hear there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Voice, and open the Door of your Heart to him, conforming your ſelf to his Will, and truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Holy Promiſes; if you let Chriſt in unto you, he will ſup with you, and you with him; that is, he will have a perfect Communion with your Spirit, and will give you an earneſt of his Glory.</p>
               <p>Your Arguments (replyed my Mother) are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very ſtrong: But cannot the Catholicks turn them to their advantage? and cannot the Prieſts interpret them in favour of their Church as well as you of yours? They may indeed do it, (ſaid he) but againſt Reaſon. For Chriſt invites us to open to him; 'tis he alone that will come in to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would have as full a Communion with us, as the Head can have with its Members. 'Tis to him alone therefore that we ought to open the door of our hearts, acknowledging him to be our only Saviour and Mediator. We muſt not open it to <hi>He-Saints,</hi> or <hi>She-Saints:</hi> No, not to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> her ſelf, who, though ſhe bare the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in her Womb, yet hath not the Power to ſave us. Let us therefore open theſe doors to Jeſus Chriſt alone. Let us ſet them wide open, and invite him to dwell with us; let us have an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confidence in his promiſes, and we ſhall be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally united to him. But let us ſhut the doors of our hearts againſt all other things; that is, let us put no Confidence in any other merit but his. 'Tis evident, that this was our Saviours Deſign: And 'tis this that the Reformed Church teacheth, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts all Perſons to hear the Voice of Chriſt, and give him entrance, and none other. Whereas in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> we are called upon to open the doors of our Hearts to Saints of both S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>xes, eſpecially to the Bleſſed Virgin. Hence it follows, that to hear the Voice of Chriſt, and open the doors of our hearts to him, we muſt adhere to that Church
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59835:100"/>which acknowledgeth his Merit to be alone neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and efficacious for the Salvation of Souls; and if our Church be not this Church, I am out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I could not forbear reading in his Books, I found many of controverſie, amongſt others I ſaw a little Manuſcript, which as far as I could judge by the hand and Style, was of his own Writing and Compoſure a little before his Death.

Firſt of all, it quoted expreſly thoſe paſſages, in which it was affirmed, that the Church muſt be expoſed to a thouſand ſufferings, and there were many curious reaſonings on this ſubject. In the ſecond place he confirmed this Truth, by all the Miſeries that had befallen the Ancient Church. He paſſed on in the third place, to thoſe that the Proteſtants had endured, by Wars, Maſſacres, and Torments. In the fourth place, he proved that the Reformed Church was the true Church, which the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59835:103"/>which of us ſhe had brought into the world. I was ſo far from being jealous at this kindneſs, that I rejoyced at it with all my heart: Beſides, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur and Madam <hi>de Roche Blanche</hi> had ſuch ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for me, that I had no reaſon to be diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>This Evening at Supper, Madam <hi>de Roche Blanche</hi> earneſtly invited my Mother to go with her to her houſe. My Mother excuſed her ſelf for a while, but ſeeing Madam <hi>de Roche Blanche</hi> would take no denyal, ſhe at laſt conſented. 'Twas therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that Monſieur and Madam <hi>de Roche Blanche,</hi> my Mother, Madamoiſelle <hi>de Gariſolles,</hi> and I, ſhould take this Journey, and that Monſieur <hi>de Haute-Cour</hi> and my Brother ſhould tarry at <hi>Ombreval,</hi> to give order concerning ſome Affairs there; though 'twas ſomewhat cruel to be ſeparated from my Lover; yet I diverted my ſelf as well as I could all the Road. I found the Caſtle of <hi>Roche Blanche,</hi> the Gardens, and all other things there in a better Eſtate than I could have imagined: We abode in this delicate place four or five days, during which we were admirably treated, and took many plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and diverting Walks. At length we were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſeparate, becauſe the time in which we were to be at Madam <hi>de la Gardes</hi> Caſtle drew near; my Mother and I took our leaves with many tears which were preſages of the end of our mirth, and that we ſhould never all meet again, which indeed we never did. Monſieur <hi>de Roche Blanche</hi> ordered four Troopers to guard us. My Lover and my Brother rode to meet us, and after having ſaluted us, came into the Coach to us, and we all arrived at <hi>Ombreval</hi> almoſt as ſoon as it was Night.</p>
               <p>The four Troopers abode with us three or four days, for we reſolved to make uſe of them to guard us to Madam <hi>de la Gardes,</hi> where we came the day before they deſigned to receive the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:59835:103"/>Supper. Madam <hi>de la Garde</hi> was exceeding glad to ſee me. My Mother and ſhe knew each other, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen each other at <hi>Paris,</hi> when they were Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, but being of a different Religion and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, they had no great Acquaintance; beſides, they did not know each other by the Names of Madam <hi>de la Garde,</hi> and Madam <hi>d' Ombreval.</hi> Our Joy at this meeting was ſo great, that I wonder we dyed not of it, as 'tis ſaid ſome have done; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that of Madam <hi>de la Garde</hi> was much increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when ſhe underſtood by me that my Mother was come hither to abjure the Romiſh Religion.</p>
               <p>That the Domeſticks might not ſuſpect their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, they had pitch'd on a week-day rather than the Lords Day, to celebrate the Supper, beſides the Garden was an admirable place for ſuch work. The ſame Miniſter in whoſe Preſence I had made my Declaration, came the Evening before, and was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ready to do what we now deſired of him, as he had been before with reſpect to me. The ſame Evening he had a long Diſcourſe with my Mother, with which he was well ſatisfied; ſo that the next morning my Mother was Received, to the common joy of us all, and with the ſame formalities, and before the ſame Witneſſes that I were, but ſhe would not receive any atteſtation from the Miniſter. After which the Miniſter made a ſhort, but good and Learned Sermon, with which I was much edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; as alſo was my Mother, who ſoon perceived a great deal of difference between it and the empty traſh that's uſually vented by the Preachers of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Neither ſhe nor I had ever heard ſuch a Sermon before, ſo that we received the Word of God as hungry Souls. Afterwards we communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with a thouſand times more Devotion and Piety than ever we had at Maſs, ſo neceſſary is the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59835:104"/>Knowledge of the Truth to make a good Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant: The ſinging of Pſalms, and Prayers, in a Tongue that we underſtood, much affected us, we not having been uſed to hear ſuch things; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my Mother was raviſhed at the Song of <hi>Simeon,</hi> which is ordinarily ſung at the end of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in which ſhe found words that wonderfully ſuited her Condition.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as all was over: Alas, ſaid my Mother to Madam <hi>de la Garde,</hi> how ſingular a Conſolation have I been all my Life deprived of, in being kept from the Knowledge of the true Religion! Oh how criminal are thoſe that would deſtroy ſo devout, ſo ſpiritual, ſo edifying a Worſhip! After the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible ſatisfaction which I have received, I may truly apply to my ſelf, what we but now ſung, Oh <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in peace, for mine Eyes have ſeen thy Salvation.</hi> Let Death come when it will, I expect it with Joy. And I hope that God will not ſuffer me to languiſh long in this World, ſeeing I deſire the full enjoyment of thoſe Bleſſings, whereof he hath given me an Earneſt at preſent. Madam, (anſwered Madam <hi>de la Garde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>) we ought to ſay as our Lord did before his Paſſion, <hi>Father, not my Will, but thy Will be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We abode all this day with Madam <hi>de la Garde,</hi> and the next Morning took our leaves of her, though much againſt the Conſent of this obliging Lady, whom my Mother thanked as well as ſhe could. If I wept formerly when I parted from her, I now wept more, foreſeeing the miſeries that were like to befall me. My Mother would not ſuffer them to accompany us. During all our Journey we diſcourſed of the Excellency of the Worſhip of the Reformed, above that of the Papiſts, in ſtirring up
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59835:104"/>true Piety in the Soul. For my part, (ſaid my mother, the more I examine things, the more I admire the Conduct of Divine Providence. You know, <hi>(Juſtine,)</hi> how furious I was in matters of Religion. I remember the time in which had any one aſſured me that you would have been a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, I believe I ſhould have ſtrangled you in your Cradle, and yet God made choice of you to be an Inſtrument of my Convertion.

My Brother was no more
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59835:105"/>able to refrain from Tears than I, nor Monſieur <hi>de Haute-Cour</hi> than either of us, though we uſed our utmoſt endeavours to ſtop them. Some ſhort time after my Mother dyed in our Arms, her laſt words being that Paſſage which ſhe had often in her Mouth, <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in Peace, for my Eyes have ſeen thy Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis impoſſible for me to give you a true Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Condition in which we then were. Alas, how often did I envy my Mother! I need not take much pains to perſwade you that I had reaſon to be much afflicted. 'Twas well for us that Madam <hi>de Broſſes</hi> was with us, to take ſome Care about the buſineſs of the Family, which was now in a terrible Deſolation; for as for Monſieur <hi>de Haute-Cour,</hi> his time was taken up in Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, who had like to have followed my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Grave, ſo that he was incapable of minding any other buſineſs; beſides, he had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Affection for my Mother, as ſhe had alſo for him. As for my Brother, whom my Mother had loved ſo tenderly, he was ſo affected with this ſtroak, that for ſeveral days he could not reſt, nor would he ſo much as eat, but when forced to it.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Roche-Blanche,</hi> and Madamoiſelle <hi>de Gariſſolles</hi> came very opportunely to awaken him out of this Lethargy: Their coming cauſed us all to weep afreſh. We buried my Mother without any Ceremony, near my Father, as ſhe had ordered, and we did what diſcovered not only to all that were in the Caſtle, but alſo to all the Village, that my Mother and I were of the <hi>Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> which was, that we ſent for no Prieſt when
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59835:106"/>my Mother lay on her Death-bed, nor buried her in Catholick and Holy Ground, as they are pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to term it. Theſe things made a great noiſe in the Countrey, and ſtirred up many againſt us, but I could never fully learn what Miſchief they had deſign'd to do us.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Roche-Blanche</hi> had ſcarce been with us two days, before ſhe received a Letter from her Husband, in which he gave her an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that there was a Deſign form'd to carry me into a Convent by force, and that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved me to be upon my Guard. The day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing this Advice was confirm'd, and 'twas ſaid moreover, that Madamoiſelle <hi>Gariſſoles</hi> was to be carried away with me, and that we were to be ſhut up in two different Convents. This News terribly aſtoniſhed us, and we were forced to leave off weeping, to provide for our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
               <p>We dayly received very troubleſome Tydings from divers places, but the worſt of all was, that a certain Perſon was coming from the King to demand me, and take me from my Brother and Lover, and that beſides this, he was to trouble my Brother for his Eſtate. Madam <hi>de Breſſes</hi> offered to carry us out of the Kingdom into <hi>Pomerania,</hi> where we might be ſafe; this Propoſition was accepted with reſpect to me, as for Madamoiſelle <hi>de Gariſſolles</hi> it was reſolved that ſhe ſhould return home, and that 'twas not likely they would come to ſnatch her out of the Arms of her Father and Mother. We had no time to loſe: I may truly ſay, that my Eyes are inexhauſtable Fountains of Tears, for I ſhed abundance when I parted from Madam <hi>de Roche
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59835:106"/>Blanche,</hi> my Lover, and Madamoiſelle <hi>de Gariſſolles.</hi> Mounſieur <hi>de Haute-Cour</hi> would willingly have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied me, but I forbad him by all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority I had over him, for I feared leaſt by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus he might bring much trouble on his Head. I would not have ſo much as my Brother go with me, for fear leſt it ſhould be ſaid he had convey'd me away.</p>
               <p>Thus I was forced to leave thoſe that were moſt dear to me, and my Miſeries were ſo far from having an end, that they daily ſeem'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

All my Fardles were alſo by the Artifice of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Broſſes</hi> ſafely convey'd, and had I not been taken ſick by the way, I believe we ſhould have been in <hi>Pomerania</hi> before now. At length we came to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where I found a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of my Brothers, with Letters for my Aunt and Me, both from my Lover and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>In theſe Letters I had an Account of what is too long to relate, for 'twould furniſh mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for another Hiſtory. I ſhall only tell you, that amongſt much ſad News, I learnt that my Brother, my Lover, and Madamoiſelle <hi>de Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſolles</hi> were come out of <hi>France</hi> towards <hi>Pomera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and that I ſhould in a ſhort time ſee them, and that 'twas the Will of Mounſieur and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Roche Blanche</hi> that our Marriages ſhould be celebrated as ſoon as we ſhould meet; ſo that I hope to find at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> thoſe three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom Love, Eſteem, and Nature, oblige me to Honour and Cheriſh.</p>

               <p>Thus, ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de St. Phale,</hi> you have heard my Hiſtory, which I may juſtly call Sad and Tragical; for, for the few Moments of Joy which I have had, I have felt a thouſand Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and ſhed tears without Numbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. In this very moment that I now ſpeak to you, my Heart is divided between Hope and Fear, about the News that I ſhall hear at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> ſo that you would pity me, could you but be ſenſible of it.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ſhe had ended, every one of the Company gave her their thanks, and declared the ſatisfaction they had received in the relation of theſe Adventures, which furniſhed matter for a Converſation, concerning the divers Accidents we are in this Life expoſed to. The two <hi>Hamburgh</hi> Ladies took occaſion to Compliment Madamoiſelle <hi>de St. Phale</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reſh, and to offer her their Houſe; their Father in a very obliging manner did the ſame thing. The <hi>Daniſh</hi> Baron pray'd Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle <hi>de St. Phale</hi> that ſince he was obliged to lay aſide all the Hopes he might have conceived, ſhe would allow him at leaſt a part in her Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to which ſhe anſwered like one very well bred, and that was not unacquainted with the World.</p>
               <p>Thus paſſed this day, and the Company brake up, each retiring to his Cabin, in hopes the next morning to ſee <hi>Hamburgh.</hi> 'Twas about Nine a Clock in the Morning before we diſcovered this famous City, and about half an hour after Ten we entred the Port, where we landed; and whilſt we were giving Order for the Carriage of our Fardles, a Coach ſtopt near the place where we
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59835:107"/>were; at firſt we took no great Notice of them that were in it, nor they of us, but the action of a Lacquey who came and threw himſelf at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle <hi>de St. Phale</hi>'s Feet much ſurprized us: Ah <hi>Joli-Bois,</hi> cryed ſhe, Where's thy Maſter? He is, Madamoiſelle, (ſaid he) in yonder Coach, to enquire at the Port whether you are come: Immediately he left us to go to his Maſter, which was indeed Monſieur <hi>d' Ombreval,</hi> who came out of the Coach with Monſieur <hi>de Haute-Cour,</hi> and Madamoiſelle <hi>de Gariſſolles;</hi> I never ſaw two love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </p>
               <p>We were a good Company of us, and abode there ſome days to refreſh our ſelves after our Voyage. The Merchant of <hi>Hambourgh</hi> invited us to go to an Houſe of Pleaſure which he had in the Countrey near the <hi>Elbe,</hi> where we were treated with unexpreſſible Magnificence for an whole day, with ſome of the principal Ladies of <hi>Hambourgh</hi> who ſpake French: There were alſo ſome other excellent Perſons for Worth and Beauty, ſo that there was nothing wanting to make this Aſſembly perfect.</p>

               <p>I muſt needs ſay, that the Power of Joy with Love is very wonderful.
